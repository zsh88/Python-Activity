        "Now the code is as short and succinct as it can be. Rather than telling you the recipe that the computer follows to build a list of the cubes of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, it tells you that it calculates the cube of x for every x starting from 1 and smaller than 6. This, then, is the essence of Pythonic coding: reducing the gap between what you say and what you mean when you tell the computer what it should do. A list comprehension can also filter its inputs when building a list. To do this, you add an if expression to the end of the comprehension, where the expression can be any test of an input value that returns True or False. This is useful when you want to transform some of the values in a list while ignoring others. As an example, you could build a photo gallery of social media posts by making a list of thumbnail images from photos found in each post, but only when the posts are pictures, not text status updates."

Comprehensions are a Pythonic tool for manipulating collections, including lists, sets, and dictionaries.
